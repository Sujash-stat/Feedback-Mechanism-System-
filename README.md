# Feedback Mechanism System
This project, developed during my internship at My Analytics School (Deepjobs Technologies Private Ltd), focuses on building a Feedback Mechanism System to enhance personalized learning. I implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, OpenAI, and gemini-pro to deliver customized video-style feedback for over 300 students. The system streamlined feedback generation, reducing operational costs by 2 Cr while improving the overall student experience.
